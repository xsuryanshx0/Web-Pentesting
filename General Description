Penetration testing of web applications, commonly known as web application testing, 
is a systematic process of evaluating the security gaps and weaknesses of a web application. 
This involves actively probing the application for potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.
When testing web applications, security professionals use various techniques and tools to simulate real attacks and try to bypass security controls.
This process helps detect vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), unprotected direct object references, and many others.
The main purpose of web application testing is to identify information security gaps that could lead to unauthorized use, data breaches or other harmful actions. 
Through thorough testing and analysis, organizations can proactively address vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
Web application testers follow a comprehensive approach that typically involves reconnaissance,
mapping the application's attack surface, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and using them to confirm their existence. 
They document their findings and make recommendations for remediation so organizations can strengthen their application security.
The importance of web application testing cannot be overstated, as web applications are often a prime target for cyber attacks due to their widespread use and potential storage of sensitive data.
Through regular pre-testing, organizations can ensure the security and robustness of their web applications, protect user data and maintain customer trust in an increasingly interconnected digital world.
